Materials Needed:
Raspberry Pi 3/4
RPi Power Supply
Micro-HDMI to HDMI Cable
Ethernet Cable (optional)
Monitor/Keyboard/Mouse
(2) 2-Wire Connectors
Monochrome IR-sensitive Camera

Step 1:
Perform the initial Raspberry Pi Setup (including internet connection)
The following link has a guide:
https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up
After initial boot, ensure the software is up-to-date:
-Open the terminal
-Enter the following commands (requires internet connection)
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
sudo apt-get install python-pip

Step 2:
Configure the Raspberry Pi for camera use
-Open the desktop menu in the top left
-Go to Preferences > Raspberry Pi configuration
-Open the Interfaces tab
-Enable the Camera option and click OK
-Reboot the Raspberry Pi if prompted (Or shutdown and connect the camera if you haven't already)

Step 3:
Install the necessary python libraries for the camera
For native Raspberry Pi cameras: https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.0/install2.html
-Open the terminal
-Test the camera functionality (optional)
raspistill -o file_name.jpg (captures an image)
raspivid -o file_name.jpg (captures a video)
-Enter the following command (requires internet connection)
sudo pip install picamera

For ArduCam third-party cameras: https://www.arducam.com/docs/cameras-for-raspberry-pi/mipi-camera-modules/camera-userland-driver-sdk-and-examples/
-Open the terminal
-Enter the following commands (requires internet connection)
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libzbar-dev libopencv-dev
sudo apt-get install python-opencv
git clone https://github.com/ArduCAM/MIPI_Camera.git
cd MIPI_Camera/RPI/
make install
chmod +x enable_i2c_vc.sh
./enable_i2c_vc.sh
-Click Y/y to reboot now (only if prompted)
-Enter the following commands
cd MIPI_Camera/RPI/
make clean && make
-If a fatal error for opencv occurs, enter the following command and re-enter the two above
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
sudo pip install 4vl2

Step 4:
Import or create python code to run camera tests
-Enter the following commands
For native RPi cameras:
curl -l https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmp52468/Haidekker-Lab/master/run-rpi-test.py > /home/pi/cf_capture.py

For third-party ArduCam cameras:
curl -l https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmp52468/Haidekker-Lab/master/run-arducam-test.py > /home/pi/MIPI_Camera/RPI/python/cf_capture.py

Step 5:
Raspberry Pi 3/4 pin schematic: https://pinout.xyz/pinout/pwm
Connect pin 33 and ground to the excitation led relay

Step 6:
Run camera tests
To use native Raspberry Pi cameras:
-Enter the following commands
python /home/pi/cf_capture.py

To use ArduCam third-party cameras:
-Enter the following commands
python /home/pi/MIPI_Camera/RPI/python/cf_capture.py

Step 7:
Connect to OneDrive cloud service
The following link has a guide:

Step 8:
Set Up Samba/CIFS system for network


Step 9:
Install ImageJ2/Fiji


Step 10:
Set up automated image capture and processing
