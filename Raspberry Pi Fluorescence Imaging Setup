Materials Needed:
Raspberry Pi 4
RPi Power Supply
Micro-HDMI to HDMI Cable
Ethernet Cable or WAP
Monitor/Keyboard/Mouse
(2) 2-Wire Connectors
Third-party ArduCam Monochrome IR-sensitive Camera
Server PC (For CIFS)

Step 1:
Perform the initial Raspberry Pi Setup (including internet connection)
The following link has a guide:
https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up
After initial boot, ensure the software is up-to-date:
-Connect to WAP or ethernet
-Open the terminal
-Enter the following commands (requires internet connection; may need to be run multiple times to ensure completion)
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade

Step 2:
Configure the Raspberry Pi for camera use (and SSH if desired)
-Open the desktop menu in the top left
-Go to Preferences > Raspberry Pi configuration
-Open the Interfaces tab
-Enable the Camera and I2C options and click OK (check the SSH option as well if desired)
-Reboot the Raspberry Pi if prompted (or shutdown and connect the camera if you haven't already)
-For instructions on how to SSH: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/unix.md
-Enter the following commands to find the RPi's IP address:
hostname -I

-To enter into the RPi from a Linux or Mac machine, enter the following command into a terminal:
ssh pi@ip.address

Step 3:
For ArduCam third-party cameras: https://www.arducam.com/docs/cameras-for-raspberry-pi/mipi-camera-modules/camera-userland-driver-sdk-and-examples/
-Open the terminal
-Enter the following commands (requires internet connection)
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libzbar-dev libopencv-dev
sudo apt-get install python-opencv
sudo pip install v4l2
git clone https://github.com/ArduCAM/MIPI_Camera.git
cd MIPI_Camera/RPI/
make install
chmod +x enable_i2c_vc.sh
./enable_i2c_vc.sh
-Click Y/y to reboot now (only if prompted)
-Enter the following commands
cd MIPI_Camera/RPI/
make clean && make
-If a fatal error for opencv occurs, enter the following command and re-enter the two above
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev

Step 4:
Import or create python code to run camera tests
-Enter the following commands
For third-party ArduCam cameras:
curl -l https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmp52468/Haidekker-Lab/master/cf_capture.py > /home/pi/MIPI_Camera/RPI/python/cf_capture.py

-Modify the capture script values to fit the setup:
sudo nano /home/pi/MIPI_Camera/RPI/python/cf_capture.py

Step 5:
Raspberry Pi 3/4 pin schematic: https://pinout.xyz/pinout/pwm
-Connect pin 33 and ground to the excitation led relay

Step 6:
Run camera tests
To use ArduCam third-party cameras:
-Enter the following commands
python /home/pi/MIPI_Camera/RPI/python/cf_capture.py

Step 7:
Connect to OneDrive cloud service
The following link has a guide:
https://jarrodstech.net/how-to-raspberry-pi-onedrive-sync/
-Once connected, enter the following commands:
sudo mkdir /home/pi/rclone

Step 8:
Set Up Samba/CIFS system for network
-Enter the following commands:
sudo mkdir /home/pi/smbshare

-Edit fstab file to enable CIFS mounting on reboot:
sudo nano /etc/fstab

-Add the following to the end of the fstab file:
//<network.ip.address>/<sambaShareName> /home/pi/smbshare cifs user=<sambaShareUsername>,password=<sambaSharePassword> 0 0

-Change settings to allow for automounting:
sudo raspi-config

-Go to Boot Options > Wait for Network at Boot > Enable

-Test CIFS mounting:
sudo mount -a
cd /home/pi/smbshare
df

-If mounted properly, network ip address should be shown at bottom. Otherwise, check previous steps. Reboot when mount works

Step 9:
Install ImageJ
-Enter the following commands:
sudo apt install xvfb
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmp52468/Haidekker-Lab/master/start_xvfb.sh > /home/pi/start_xvfb.sh
chmod +x /home/pi/start_xvfb.sh

sudo apt install imagej
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmp52468/Haidekker-Lab/master/CF_Imaging.ijm > /home/pi/CF_Imaging.ijm

-Add the following line to /etc/rc.local file:
/home/pi/start_xvfb.sh

Step 10:
Set up automated image capture and processing
-Enter the following commands:
mkdir /home/pi/CF_Images
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmp52468/Haidekker-Lab/master/auto_cf_imaging.sh > /home/pi/auto_cf_imaging.sh
chmod +x /home/pi/auto_cf_imaging.sh

-Modify the shell script to fit your cloud layout:
sudo nano /home/pi/auto_cf_imaging.sh

-Check user environment PATH variable:
echo PATH

-Modify the crontab file to enable automatic file execution:
crontab -e

-Add PATH variable and following scheduled tasks to the bottom of crontab:
PATH=<user's/path/variable>

0 0 * * * /home/pi/auto_cf_imaging.sh >> /home/pi/my.log 2>&1
0-50/10 1 * * * if [ -e /home/pi/CF_Images/cf_image.jpg ]; then /home/pi/auto_cf_imaging.sh >> /home/pi/my.log 2>&1; fi

Step 11:
-Set the date and time with the following command:
sudo date -s 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'
