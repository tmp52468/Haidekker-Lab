Materials Needed:
Raspberry Pi 3/4
RPi Power Supply
Micro-HDMI to HDMI Cable
Ethernet Cable (optional)
Monitor/Keyboard/Mouse
(2) 2-Wire Connectors
Raspberry Pi Compatible Camera

Step 1:
Perform the initial Raspberry Pi Setup
The following link has a guide:
https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/articles/set-up-raspberry-pi-4
After initial boot, ensure the software is up-to-date:
-Open the terminal
-Enter the following commands (requires internet connection)
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade

Step 2:
Configure the Raspberry Pi for camera use
-Open the desktop menu in the top left
-Go to Preferences > Raspberry Pi configuration
-Open the Interfaces tab
-Enable the Camera option and click OK
-Reboot the Raspberry Pi (Or shutdown and connect the camera if you haven't already)

Step 3:
Install the necessary python libraries for the camera
For native Raspberry Pi cameras: https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.0/install2.html
-Open the terminal
-Test the camera functionality (optional)
raspistill -o file_name.jpg (captures an image)
raspivid -o file_name.jpg (captures a video)
-Enter the following commands (requires internet connection)
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install picamera

For ArduCam third-party cameras: https://www.arducam.com/docs/cameras-for-raspberry-pi/mipi-camera-modules/camera-userland-driver-sdk-and-examples/
-Open the terminal
-Enter the following commands (requires internet connection)
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libzbar-dev libopencv-dev
sudo apt-get install python-opencv
git clone https://github.com/ArduCAM/MIPI_Camera.git
cd MIPI_Camera/RPI/
make install
chmod +x enable_i2c_vc.sh
./enable_i2c_vc.sh
-Click Y/y to reboot now (only if prompted)
-Enter the following commands
cd MIPI_Camera/RPI/
make clean && make
-If a fatal error for opencv occurs, enter the following command and re-enter the two above
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev

Step 4:
Import or create python code to run camera tests
For native Raspberry Pi cameras: https://github.com/tmp52468/Haidekker-Lab/blob/master/run-camera-test.py
*Can be placed in any directory
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO           #Import the GPIO library
import time                       #Import the time library
from picamera import PiCamera     #Import the camera library

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)          #Set pin name mode
GPIO.setup(32, GPIO.OUT)          
pwmAct = GPIO.PWM(32, 1000)       #Set pin 32 to pwm for actinic led
GPIO.setup(33, GPIO.OUT)
pwmEx = GPIO.PWM(33, 1000)        #Set pin 33 to pwm for excitation led

camera = PiCamera()               #Set up the raspberry pi camera

#Main Program     

dc = 50                           #Set the duty cycle of pwm for pins
pwmAct.start(dc)                  #Start actinic led at duty cycle
time.sleep(10)                    #Wait 10 seconds for plant to react

camera.capture('Actinic.jpg')     #Capture actinic image

pwmEx.start(dc)                   #Start excitation led at duty cycle

camera.capture('Excitation.jpg')  #Capture excitation image

pwmEx.stop()                      #Stop excitation led
pwmAct.stop()                     #Stop actinic led
GPIO.cleanup()                    #Reset pins

print("DONE")

For ArduCam third-party cameras:
*Must be placed in MIPI_Camera/RPI/python/ directory




Step 5:
Raspberry Pi 3/4 pin schematic: https://pinout.xyz/pinout/pwm
Connect pin 32 and ground to the actinic led
Connect pin 33 and ground to the excitation led

Step 6:
Run camera tests
-Navigate to the folder containing the python code
-Enter the following command
python camera_test_script.py
